</blockquote>
<p>When I first thought about starting this project, I was pretty intimidated.
I had assumed that renderers are such vastly complicated things that I couldn&rsquo;t possibly hope to understand them.
But I found a nice little guide about writing one in C, and I decided to follow it.
But rather than just following it in C, I decided to do it in Rust.</p>
<p>And that was for 2 simple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn&rsquo;t want to simply be able to copy-paste the parts I didn&rsquo;t understand. I wanted to
have to somehow try to understand what was going on before adapting it to Rust.</li>
<li>I simply like the safety of Rust, and how it makes it so that I have much fewer things to worry about
than in C.</li>
</ol>
