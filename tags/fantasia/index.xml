      <description>A 3D renderer I decided to write as a practice project, in Rust, with as few dependencies as possible.
When I first thought about starting this project, I was pretty intimidated. I had assumed that renderers are such vastly complicated things that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly hope to understand them. But I found a nice little guide about writing one in C, and I decided to follow it. But rather than just following it in C, I decided to do it in Rust.</description>

&lt;p&gt;A 3D renderer I decided to write as a practice project, in Rust, with as few dependencies as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first thought about starting this project, I was pretty intimidated.
I had assumed that renderers are such vastly complicated things that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly hope to understand them.
But I found a nice little guide about writing one in C, and I decided to follow it.
But rather than just following it in C, I decided to do it in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that was for 2 simple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to simply be able to copy-paste the parts I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand. I wanted to
have to somehow try to understand what was going on before adapting it to Rust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I simply like the safety of Rust, and how it makes it so that I have much fewer things to worry about
than in C.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also check out my progress on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aliencdh/fantasia&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
